# My (Git-JSON) Resume!

This repo hosts my resume and serves it to [aceamarco.dev](https://www.aceamarco.dev)!

Using an amazing open source project, [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) to 
generate my resume in my favorite [public theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonresume-theme-macchiato-ibic) 
and [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to continuously deploy new versions of it whenever I update my `resume.json` file!

# Why is this cool?

The fact that I can generate my resume in 250+ themes is already really cool (thank you JSON Resume), but I thought I'd take it a step further by creating a build pipeline that can keep track of any changes to my resume!

# How does it work?

My [`resume.json`](resume.json) file is where all the data for my resume is held. Through Github Actions, when changes are pushed to `master/resume.json` we use JSON Resume to make a resume pdf and html file. Github Pages takes the `index.html` file generated by the Github Action and hosts it for free.

# How do I get this for myself?

Fork my repo and you're all set! Make changes to the `resume.json` file in your forked repo and your pdf/html files will be updated to your resume.
